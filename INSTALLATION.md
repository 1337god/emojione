### Installation

We've teamed up with [JSDelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!emojione) to provide a simple way to install these emoji on any javascript-enabled website. Add the following script and stylesheet links to the head of your webpage:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/3.0/lib/js/emojione.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/3.0/assets/css/emojione.min.css"/>
```

Alternatively, CDNjs is also available as a [CDN Host for EmojiOne](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/emojione).

Quick installs can also be done using NPM and Bower (for the Javascript toolkit) or Composer (for the PHP toolkit).

#### NPM
```
> npm install emojione
```

#### Bower
```
> bower install emojione
```


#### Composer
```
$ composer require emojione/emojione
```

#### Meteor
```
meteor add emojione:emojione
```

### Version 2 Installation
If you're looking to use emojione < version 3.0, refer to the 2.2.7 branch. **CDN dependency has been preserved for version 2.**
